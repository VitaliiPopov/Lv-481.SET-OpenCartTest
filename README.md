Our team tested [OpenCart](https://demo.opencart.com/) application. Opencart is an easy to-use, powerful, Open Source online store management program that can manage multiple online stores from a single back-end. It has many professionally-written extensions available to customize the store to your needs. We created the well adapted architecture of website for further effective testing. Firstly, we tested it locally with virtual machine on CentOS Then we performed general testing of OpenCart in Microsoft Azure. After that we set up Selenium Grid and create pipeline on Jenkins, which raise infrastructure with Selenium Grid and after that perform tests.
